❌ Don’t dive into solving problems before learning the fundamentals.

❌ Don't memorize solutions, understand the logic behind them.

❌ Don’t rush to increase your problem count. Focus on what you learned from each problem.

❌ Don't spend much time on highly disliked questions. They will drain your energy and leave you feeling demotivated.

❌ Don't jump to advanced topics until you feel comfortable with the fundamental data structures and algorithms.

❌ Don't attempt LeetCode hards if you struggle with medium ones. They aren’t asked that much anyways.

❌ Don't compare yourself to others. Progress every day is what matters.

❌ Don't get discouraged by difficult problems; it's all part of the learning process.

❌ Don’t jump between problems too quickly; give each one sufficient time and effort.


✅ If you can, maintain a problem-solving ratio of Easy:Medium:Hard = 30:50:20.

✅ Time yourself. Most interviews are only 45 mins - 1 hour long.

✅ Always read the top voted solutions. Take notes, bookmark anything new that you learned.

✅ Learn and practice topics by importance.

✅ For your weaker topics, being with easy problems.

✅ Prioritize practicing popular and frequently asked questions.

✅ Look for key patterns that will help you solve multiple problems.

✅ Get in the habit of analyzing time and space complexity of every problem you submit.

✅ Revisit problems you couldn’t solve in one attempt.

✅ Track your progress to monitor your performance and identify areas where you need improvement.

✅ Get in the habit of testing your code on small inputs, including edge cases.

✅ Participate in LeetCode contests to practice in a timed environment.
